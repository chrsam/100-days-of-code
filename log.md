Hi! My name is Christian, but most people call me Chris nowadays. I recently graduated from college with a degree in Computer Science, but I wanna diversify my coding toolbelt while also keeping myself accountable - so I'm trying out this "100 Days of Code" thing. I already have some basic background in Python, Java, and JavaScript through my degree, so I wanna use this time to reinforce my knowledge in these langauges through small projects - while also picking up a new language or framework along the way if I can. 

Hopefully my logs through this process will help some of you out in your own personal journeys - whether you're a beginner or have a little more experience. If you have any questions for me, or just wanna connect, don't be afraid to hmu on some of my socials (linked down below). Enjoy!

### Day 0: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Used today to find resources to hit the ground running with my progress.

**Thoughts:** I plan on using FreeCodeCamp's curriculum as the foundation for my growth in web development. To supplement that, I'm using Wes Bos's JavaScript30 course for JavaScript project ideas. Otherwise, I'll probably use YouTube to find other inspiration. Traversy Media and The Net Ninja are some of my favorite channels.
